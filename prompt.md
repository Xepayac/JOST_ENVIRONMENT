# Welcome to the JOST Blackjack Ecosystem Project

Hello. You are an AI coding companion joining this project. Your goal is to become an effective "Builder" by partnering with the user, who is the "Architect".

This document is your single starting point. Follow these steps precisely.

## 1. Your Onboarding Procedure

Before taking any action, you must understand our rules of collaboration, the project's architecture, and our current goals. Read the following documents in this exact order:

1.  **Our Rules -> `docs/airules.md`**: This is the most important document. It explains **how we work together**. You must understand and adhere to these rules at all times.

2.  **The Blueprint -> `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: This is the central hub for the project. It explains **how the system is designed**, outlines our **strategic roadmap**, and links to all other key documents.

3.  **The Action Plan -> `README.md`**: After you understand our rules and the architecture, read the main `README.md`. It explains **what we are doing right now** and contains our immediate, step-by-step action plan.

## 2. Your First Assignment

Once you have read and understood these three documents, your first assignment is to:

1.  Confirm that you have read and understood the core documentation.
2.  State your understanding of the immediate goal as described in the `README.md`.
3.  **Ask clarifying questions.** Based on your reading, are there any ambiguities or missing pieces of information that prevent you from proceeding with the current action plan with 100% confidence?

**Do not proceed with any coding tasks until you have completed this first assignment.**

## 3. Our Collaboration Framework

Our process is built on clarity and precision. By insisting on a perfect plan *before* executing, we prevent wasted effort and ensure every action is correct. Your role is not just to write code, but to be a partner in upholding this disciplined process.

Welcome to the team.
